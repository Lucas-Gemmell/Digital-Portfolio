            <p>

                Fernie, BC. I am interested in coding. I have coded many things since I started in April of 2024.

            <h3>Digital Footprint</h3>
            <p>I have no social media accounts currently. So I have almost no Digital Footprint. But when I do grow up I
                plan on keeping it that way so I don't have to worry about employers rejecting me based on the fact of
                something I had done years before.</p>
